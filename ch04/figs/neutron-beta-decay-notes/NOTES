used neutron decay so that coulomb shifts would be negligible; for an example that shows
    coulomb shifts, see the graphs I produced for 64Cu for SN
outline of calculation
  area of sphere in momentum space is propto p^2
  so probability propto p1^2 p2^2, where 1=electron, 2=neutrino
  change of variables to kinetic energy K and m2=0 gives
    probability ~ p1E1p2E2
          ~ (2m1K1+K1^2)^(1/2)(m1+K1)K2^2
  let k=K1/Q, so k varies from 0 to 1
  let q=Q/m1
  because KE of recoiling nucleus is negligible, k goes from 0 to 1, and energy of neutrino is 1-k
  result is the function above
Q value
  0.782343 MeV -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_neutron_decay
  so my q=Q/m_e = 1.53
curve is fit using the function
  k^(1/2)(2/q+k)^(1/2)(1/q+k)(1-k)^2
  checked against de Shalit and Feshbach, p. 777, eq. 2.9
    notation (mine, theirs)
      Q      E0-m
      q      eps0-1
      E1/m1  eps
      k      (1/eps0)(eps-1)
    checks out to within constant factors
  plotted using desmos using q=1.53

  p. 91
  fig 7.16
not reliable below about 150 keV, or about E/Emax=0.2
  e.g., hickerson doesn't try to do anything with it in fig 7.20 below that energy
  there is a lot of background at low energies, so they had to impose a trigger
  electrons have to make it through some foils
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.00776.pdf
  has figure that wasn't as useful for my purposes as thesis figure (harder to get rid of his
        monte carlo curves)
absolute normalization of y axis
  from arxiv 1707.00776, fig. 4; rescale x by 1/.782 MeV, so rescale y by .782 MeV
energy resolution
  p. 95 of pdf: energy resolution is about 53 keV at some energy, presumably at the
           peak of the spectrum, although he doesn't say so; says
           resolution should be propto sqrt(E), although they didn't find that that mattered
           enough to worry about, so they pretended it was constant
  this is how I made my energy resolution bars on the graph
low-energy data
  I picked data points at  35, 65, 95, and 145 keV
  found GEANT's estimate of efficiency by dividing GEANT curve by theory
  statistical error bars are only 0.014 (on a scale where y max=1) even for the 35 keV point, i.e.,
         would be about the size of that dot
  but statistical error bars aren't the issue; efficiency is strongly curved and concave up,
         so energy resolution leads to an overestimate of rate; therefore threw out 35 keV point
  also threw out 95 keV, just because uneven spacing makes it look goofy
high-energy data
  dots are *not* efficiency corrected, but efficiency is nearly unity at these energies
====Plaster====
https://www.jlab.org/Hall-C/talks/08_09_07/martin.pdf
  see p. 21, with credit to Plaster
has no absolute calibration of rates
ended up not using this, because the efficiency is clearly less than unity at the lower energies,
      but isn't calibrated
